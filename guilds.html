                <p>The organization was founded by Mary Sumner in 1876 in the Church of England.
                     She recalled her difficulties in child-care and training coupled with house chores and work place,
                      and realized that mothers have enormous responsibilities. She was inspired to bring mothers of all
                       social-classes together to provide support and training in motherhood so that they would be equipped
                        to face the responsibilities in their marriage and family life.
                     She taught young wives how to make good Christian home and bring up their children in the fear of God.</p>
